A repository for things that are not ready for prime time

This repo contains some of Jim Gast's public work to make 3D printer troubleshooting easier and more talkative.

I am an old guy who has been writing open-source software since the 1980's (and shareware before that!).  My first Radio Shack TRS-80 had 16K of RAM.  I wrote programs on punched paper tape because it was more reliable than cassette tapes.

I still program pretty much the same way:  Try something, fix it, ask if it satisfies the requirements, fix it, smile, feel good, ask if it satisfies the requirements (again), then throw it out and start over.
